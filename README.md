# Smiter
## Introduction
### What is this project?
I'm making this project for fun and because I wanted a better way to use *taskkill*.
### What does it do?
Basically, right now it shows you a table of processes, and depending wether you double click on the PID or Process Name, it respectively either kills the own process or any processes with that name.
### Why not use TaskManager?
That wouldn't be as fun now, would it?
